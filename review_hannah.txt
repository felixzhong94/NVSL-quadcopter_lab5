Notes for library:
- Library parts don't have the CREATOR attribute.
- Apparently you're supposed to have at least 1mm of the pad outside of the part for soldering, which we don't have either...
- Some of your tDocu lines go over your pads, like in the IMu where the gray lines are on the pads. Same for the LED, mosfet, resistor

Notes for schematic:
- There are two random capacitors floating near the microcontroller
